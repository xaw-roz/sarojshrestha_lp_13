I would adop agile methodology because
>The customer has frequent and early opportunities to see the work being delivered, and to make decisions and changes throughout the development project.
>The customer gains a strong sense of ownership by working extensively and directly with the project team throughout the project.
>If time to market for a specific application is a greater concern than releasing a full feature set at initial launch, Agile can more quickly produce a basic version of working software which can be built upon in successive iterations.

I would collect the information about the most basic services that the application has to provide. Then gradually adding more functionalities based on the prioriies and dependencies.
